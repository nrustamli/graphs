# Graph Analysis Program

This Python program provides various functionalities to analyze and visualize a given graph. It utilizes the NetworkX library for graph-related operations and Matplotlib for visualization.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- NetworkX
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
3. Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
## Functionality
1. **Directed or Undirected Graph**
- Checks whether the graph is directed or undirected.

2. **Connectivity of the Graph**
- Determines whether the graph is connected or disconnected.

3. **Weighted or Unweighted Graph**
- Identifies if the graph is weighted or unweighted.

4. **Completeness of the Graph**
- Checks if the graph is complete.

5. **Check for a Complete Subgraph**
- Prompts the user to enter a dimension 'k' and checks for the existence of a complete subgraph with 'k' vertices.

6. **Unicyclic Graph Check**
- Determines whether the graph is unicyclic.

7. **Number of Connected Components**
- Counts and displays the number of connected components in the graph.

8. **Graph Classification**
- Classifies the graph as either a complete graph, a connected graph, or a disconnected graph.

9. **Visualize the Graph**
- Visualizes the graph using Matplotlib.

10. **Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal's Algorithm)**
 - Finds and displays the minimum spanning tree of the graph using Kruskal's algorithm.

0. **Exit**
- Exits the program.

## Input
- The program prompts the user to enter the dimension of the matrix (n*n), where 'n' is between 2 and 10.
- Then, the user is asked to input the adjacency matrix of the graph row by row.

## Note
- The program uses NetworkX to create a graph from the provided adjacency matrix.
- Visualization is performed using Matplotlib, with nodes represented by numbers and edges displayed with different colors based on their type (directed or undirected).

Feel free to explore and analyze different graphs using this versatile graph analysis program!
